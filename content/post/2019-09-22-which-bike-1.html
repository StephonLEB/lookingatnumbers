Every month, Google gives me a summary of how much much I’ve traveled. It’s really cool to look at, but one creepy feature about it is that it gives me a breakdown of how much I’ve traveled by medium.

<p>There are even <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/blogs/google-maps-knows-that-i-rode-to-work-on-a-motorcycle-and-didnt-drive-down-how-3033041/">motorcycle riders’ blogs</a> where discussions have taken place about how Google know’s they’ve ridden their motorcycles as opposed to their cars.</p>
<p>One could probably guess that Google is using GPS information from our phones using speed, roads traveled and similar factors to make estimations about how we’re getting around.</p>
<p>I ride bikes a fair bit, and use 2 different bikes to get around. I set out to try something similar. I log my rides on Strava, it gives the athlete the option to choose which bike they rode. I happen to have 2 bikes, one for road riding and the other for gravel riding and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclo-cross">cyclocross</a>.</p>

<h2>Getting my rides from Strava</h2>
<p>Retrieving my rides from Strava involved using their API. <a href="http://www.open-thoughts.com/2017/01/the-quantified-cyclist-analysing-strava-data-using-r/">Here’s a good post</a> detailing the steps for ‘creating an application’ to allow you to get your data. The API response is in JSON format, but the <code>jsonlite</code> package makes it easy to flatten.</p>
<p>The max number of activities per API request is 200, so i needed to make a couple of requests to get a large number of rides. Combinining the two into a single data frame wasn’t trivial, as the tables had a different number of variables.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>token &lt;- Sys.getenv(&quot;token&quot;)

stuff &lt;- paste0(&quot;https://www.strava.com/api/v3/athlete/activities?access_token=&quot;,token,&quot;&amp;per_page=200&amp;page=1&quot;) %&gt;% fromJSON(flatten = TRUE)

stuff2 &lt;- paste0(&quot;https://www.strava.com/api/v3/athlete/activities?access_token=&quot;,token,&quot;&amp;per_page=200&amp;page=2&quot;) %&gt;% fromJSON(flatten =TRUE)

names1 &lt;- names(stuff) %&gt;% tbl_df()
names2 &lt;- names(stuff2) %&gt;% tbl_df()

names1 %&gt;% anti_join(names2) %&gt;% kable()</code></pre>

</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="left">max_heartrate</td>

<p>I used to ride with a heart rate monitor; it makes sense that these were the extra attributes from the first response.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>rides &lt;- rbind(stuff2,stuff %&gt;% select(-average_heartrate,-max_heartrate)) %&gt;% tbl_df() %&gt;%  
    mutate(year = year(start_date)) %&gt;% filter(type==&quot;Ride&quot;,

    mutate(gear_id = ifelse(gear_id==&quot;b1985937&quot;,&quot;Road&quot;,&quot;Gravel&quot;),

<h2>Exploring</h2>
<p>There are a lot of features of a Strava ride. I decided to focus on those that I had the most intuition around: moving time, elapsed time, distance, average speed, athlete count (group rides), and max speed.</p>

<div id="building-classification-models" class="section level2">
<h2>Building Classification Models</h2>
<p>My goal was to come up with a model that classified my 2019 ride data, trained on my 2018 data.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>rides_2018 &lt;- rides %&gt;% filter(year==2018)
rides_2019 &lt;- rides %&gt;% filter(year==2019)</code></pre>
<div id="logistic-regression" class="section level3">
<h3>Logistic Regression</h3>
<p>Starting from a logistic regression model using only average as the only predictor, I tried some different combinations until I landed on one using two interaction variables, one between average speed and distance and the other between average speed and athlete count.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>glm_fit &lt;- glm(data=rides_2018, gear_id  ~ average_speed*distance + 
               average_speed*athlete_count,family = &quot;binomial&quot;)

contrasts(rides_2018$gear_id)

glm_fitted &lt;- predict(glm_fit,rides_2019,type = &quot;response&quot;)

logistic &lt;- data.frame(glm_fitted, rides_2019$gear_id)
logistic &lt;- logistic %&gt;% mutate(glm_fitted = ifelse(glm_fitted&lt;.5,&quot;Gravel&quot;,&quot;Road&quot;)) 

rides_2019 %&gt;% count(gear_id) </code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>mean(logistic$glm_fitted==logistic$rides_2019.gear_id)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.7142857</code></pre>
<p>The logistic model correctly classified <strong>71%</strong> of the rides from 2019. This is fair bit better than flipping a coin, but simply guessing that all my rides were road rides would have gotten me results almost as good.</p>
</div>
<div id="k-nearest-neighbors" class="section level3">
<h3>K-Nearest Neighbors</h3>
<p>The KNN approach doesn’t bear assumptions about the shape of the decision boundary between road rides and gravel rides. Its flexibility might yield predictions closer to the 2019 data. Here I used the predictor from the logistic model with the lowest p-value, <code>average_speed*distance</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>train &lt;- rides$year==2018
test &lt;- rides$year==2019
train_1 &lt;- cbind(rides$average_speed*rides$distance)[train,] %&gt;% as.data.frame()
test_1 &lt;- cbind(rides$average_speed*rides$distance)[test,] %&gt;% as.data.frame()
gear &lt;- rides$gear_id[train] 

set.seed(100)

tests &lt;- for (i in 1:30) {
    oof &lt;- knn(train_1,test_1,gear,k=i)
    ouch &lt;- data.frame(oof,rides_2019$gear_id) ##Choosing the best K for 2019 data
    oops &lt;- mean(ouch$oof==ouch$rides_2019.gear_id)
    print(oops)
}</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>knn_pred &lt;- knn(train_1,test_1,gear,k=11) 

mean(knn_pred==rides_2019$gear_id)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.7698413</code></pre>
<p>The KNN with a K of 11 produced the model for the 2019 data, accurately predicting the bike I rode for <strong>77%</strong> of the data.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="conclusion" class="section level2">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>These models both show that there is a predictable difference between gravel rides and road rides. Being able to select the bike you rode is a useful feature, but I find it often goes neglected. Perhaps Strava could employ a (much) better model (with an actual method to the subset selection) to choose the best default for the rider depending on their ride data.</p>
<p>In part 2, I’ll use the map coordinates to try and improve these predictions.</p>
